# Scala Yaml

![Example](./docs/_assets/Scala_YAML_red.svg)

Scala Yaml is a dependency-free Scala library that allows you to work with [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).  

The goal of this project is to create an idiomatic library which:
* provides compile time type safety
* semiautomatically derives codec instances
* has explicit error handling and helpful error messages
* cross compiles to [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) and [Scala Native](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native) (waiting for Scala 3 support in SN)

Please see the [guide](https://virtuslab.github.io/scala-yaml/docs/) for more information

# Usage

Add as a dependency:

- via sbt
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.virtuslab" %% "scala-yaml" % "<version>"
```
- via scala-cli
```scala
//> using dep org.virtuslab::scala-yaml:<version>
```

and use it in your code!

```scala sc:compile
import org.virtuslab.yaml.*

case class Address(city: String, zipcode: String) derives YamlCodec
case class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address) derives YamlCodec

val yaml = s"""name: John Wick
              |age: 40
              |address:
              |  city: Anywhere
              |  zipcode: 12-345
              |""".stripMargin

val decoded = yaml.as[Person]
// Either[YamlError, Person] = Right(Person(John Wick,40,Address(Anywhere,12-345)))

case class Activity(kind: String, distance: Seq[Double]) derives YamlCodec

val activity = Activity("running", Seq(5.37, 4.98, 5.73))
val encoded  = activity.asYaml
//kind: running
//distance: 
//  - 5.37
//  - 4.98
//  - 5.73
```
